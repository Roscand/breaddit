# Breaddit: A Discussion Board Application

It is a discussion board web application similar to services like Reddit.

## Functionality
Join in the conversations just about everything. From daily news to profound analytics, from apple pie receips to michelin reviews tiers, from simple chat to philosophical dillemas. Don't worry if you didn't find a discussion to your taste - you can always create a new post in the existing branch, or simply initiate a completely new one.
Connect to others publically and privately, respect each other, and get the discussion rolling!

## Technology
It is built with MERN stack with pure React running at the client side and Node.js managing the server, MongoDB is handling the data serving user profiles, branches, posts, commments and so on.

The main reason for the app is to practice defining and managing user roles "manually" and without frameworks, intiating real time web sockets, and utilising a document-oriented DB.
